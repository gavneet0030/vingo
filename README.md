<h2 align="center"> Project Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  <b>Vingo</b> is a full-stack web application structured with separate
  frontend and backend layers, designed to demonstrate real-world
  application architecture and development workflows.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The project follows a modular approach where the frontend is
  responsible for user interaction and UI rendering, while the backend
  handles business logic, data processing, and API communication.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The repository is organized to reflect industry-standard practices,
  making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend as the application
  grows.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Key highlights of the project include:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities<br/>
  • API-based communication between client and server<br/>
  • Scalable and maintainable folder structure<br/>
  • Focus on clean code and logical data flow<br/>
  • Suitable foundation for production-ready deployment
</p>

<p align="center">
  Overall, Vingo represents a complete end-to-end application lifecycle,
  from frontend UI development to backend service implementation.
</p>

<h2 align="center"> How the Application Was Built</h2>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Vingo</b> application was built using a full-stack development
  approach, with a clear separation between the frontend and backend
  layers to ensure scalability and maintainability.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The development process started by defining the overall application
  structure, followed by independent implementation of frontend and
  backend components.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Frontend Development:</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Designed the user interface with a focus on usability and clean layout<br/>
  • Implemented reusable UI components for better code organization<br/>
  • Connected frontend views to backend APIs for dynamic data handling<br/>
  • Ensured smooth user interaction and responsive behavior
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Backend Development:</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Built server-side logic to handle application requests and responses<br/>
  • Implemented API endpoints to support frontend functionality<br/>
  • Structured backend code to support modular and scalable growth<br/>
  • Managed data flow and application logic securely and effi



<h2 align="center">Frontend–Backend Interaction</h2>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Vingo</b> application follows a client–server architecture where
  the frontend and backend communicate through well-defined APIs.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The frontend acts as the client layer, responsible for user interaction
  and interface rendering, while the backend serves as the core logic
  layer that processes requests and returns responses.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The interaction flow between frontend and backend includes:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • User performs an action on the frontend interface<br/>
  • Frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend API<br/>
  • Backend validates the request and executes business logic<br/>
  • Backend sends a structured response back to the frontend<br/>
  • Frontend updates the UI based on the received data
</p>

<p align="center">
  This separation ensures better maintainability, scalability, and
  easier debugging, while allowing each layer to evolve independently.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The architecture supports future enhancements such as authentication,
  role-based access, and external service integration.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Technology Stack</h2>

<p align="center">
  The <b>Vingo</b> application is built using a modern full-stack
  technology stack, with separate tools and technologies for the
  frontend and backend layers.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Frontend Technologies:</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Used to build the user interface and handle client-side interactions<br/>
  • Responsible for rendering views and capturing user input<br/>
  • Communicates with the backend through API requests
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Backend Technologies:</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Used to implement server-side logic and APIs<br/>
  • Handles data processing, validation, and business rules<br/>
  • Manages communication between the frontend and the application logic
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>General Tools & Practices:</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  • API-based client–server communication<br/>
  • Modular folder structure for scalability<br/>
  • Clean code and separation of concerns<br/>
  • Version control using Git and GitHub
</p>

<p align="center">
  This technology stack enables the application to remain scalable,
  maintainable, and suitable for real-world production environments.

<h2 align="center"> Big-O Performance Analysis</h2>

<p align="center">
  Although <b>Vingo</b> is a full-stack web application and not a
  traditional algorithm-based system, understanding performance
  complexity helps evaluate how efficiently the application behaves
  as data and users grow.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The table below summarizes the time complexity of common operations
  involved in the application.
</p>

<p align="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Layer</th>
    <th>Operation</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Time Complexity</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Frontend</td>
    <td>DOM Rendering</td>
    <td>Rendering UI elements based on data</td>
    <td>O(n)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Frontend</td>
    <td>Event Handling</td>
    <td>Handling user clicks and input events</td>
    <td>O(1)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Backend</td>
    <td>API Request Handling</td>
    <td>Processing client requests</td>
    <td>O(1)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Backend</td>
    <td>Data Retrieval</td>
    <td>Fetching records from storage</td>
    <td>O(n)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Backend</td>
    <td>Data Search</td>
    <td>Searching through records</td>
    <td>O(n)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Here, <b>n</b> represents the number of records or UI elements being
  processed. Optimizing DOM updates and backend queries helps maintain
  good performance as the application scales.
